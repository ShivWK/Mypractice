<!-- The issue you're encountering is due to the Same-Origin Policy (SOP), which restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. Since your HTML file is being served from a local file system (file://), and you're trying to fetch a JSON file from the same local file system, you're running into CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions.

To resolve this issue, you can either:

Serve your HTML file from a local server: You can use tools like Live Server (for VS Code) or XAMPP to serve your HTML file from a local server. This way, both your HTML file and the JSON file will have the same origin, and you won't encounter CORS issues.

Use a data URI: If your JSON data is small, you can embed it directly into your HTML file using a data URI. This bypasses the need for a separate JSON file and avoids CORS issues altogether. -->
